# Minions

Minions is a simulation system where agents, called SwarmAgents, navigate an environment to seek a target while avoiding obstacles. The behavior of these agents is driven by a behavior tree parsed from an XML file.

## Features

- Agents navigate the environment and avoid obstacles.
- Agents change their color when they detect or reach the target.
- Agents return to their nest after completing the task.
- Behavior trees control the logic of agent actions.
